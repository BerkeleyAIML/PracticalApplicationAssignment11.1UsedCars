    "In this application, you will explore a dataset from kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car."

This process provides a framework for working through a data problem.  Your first step in this application will be to read through a brief overview of CRISP-DM [here](https://mo-pcco.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BH-PCMLAI/module_11/readings_starter.zip).  After reading the overview, answer the questions below."

We will use a dataset of used car sales to build a model that can predict the price of a used car based on its features. The dependent variable is the car's price, while the independent variables are possible predictors such as the make, model, year, mileage, condition, and additional features.  The model will be used to identify the key drivers of used car prices. The model's performance will be evaluated using R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to guarantee reliable and actionable results.\n"
